Dear Professor Smith,

My name is Emma Jones and I am a sophomore in your Tuesday/Thursday General Physics Class.  I am writing because in class yesterday you mentioned having some open positions in your research lab.  I found the summary of your project very interesting, and I would like to learn more and possibly talk to you about joining the lab.  Is there a time in the coming weeks that we could meet?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,

Dear sir,

Dear Dr. Smith,

My name is X and I'm a second year biology major at UVa. In my introductory and upper-level coursework, I've developed a passion for science and am extremely interested in pursuing independent research as an undergraduate. An extensive research experience will greatly help me consolidate my future career choice.

I am personally greatly interested in the molecular biology of stem cells. Recently I read your 2011 paper on the role of microRNAs in the differentiation of muscle stem cells and became fascinated by your work. In particular, I found it amazing that microRNAs can alter the fate of a cell in such a profound way. If possible, I would love to start working on a long-term project in your lab beginning this summer.

Would you be available to meet sometime this week to discuss your research? I would also be happy to volunteer in your lab for a few weeks before we commit to anything to see if this is a good match. My transcript and resume are attached in case you are interested. I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you,


Thanks and regards
