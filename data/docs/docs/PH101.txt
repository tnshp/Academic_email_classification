## Course Policies

### Grading

- Homework Assignments: 20%
- Laboratory Reports: 20%
- Midterm Exams (2): 30% (15% each)
- Final Exam: 25%
- Class Participation and Quizzes: 5%

### Late Submission Policy

Assignments submitted after the deadline will incur a 10% penalty per day, up to a maximum of 3 days. After 3 days, submissions will not be accepted without prior arrangement with the instructor.

### Academic Integrity

Students are expected to adhere to the university's academic integrity policy. Plagiarism, cheating, or any form of academic dishonesty will result in severe penalties, including possible failure of the course.

### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory for all laboratory sessions. For lectures, while attendance is not required, it is strongly encouraged. Students are responsible for all material covered in class, including any announcements or changes to the syllabus.

## Required Materials

- Textbook: "University Physics" by Young and Freedman (15th Edition or latest)
- Scientific calculator (graphing calculators are allowed, but not required)
- Laboratory notebook
- Access to the online homework system (details to be provided in class)

## Laboratory Component

The laboratory component of this course is designed to reinforce concepts learned in lectures and develop experimental skills. Students will perform experiments, collect and analyze data, and write formal lab reports. Safety guidelines must be strictly followed in all lab sessions.

## Office Hours

Instructor office hours will be held twice a week, with additional appointments available upon request. Teaching assistants will also hold regular office hours and problem-solving sessions to provide additional support.

## Accommodations

Students requiring accommodations due to disabilities or other circumstances should contact the instructor and the university's disability services office as early as possible to ensure appropriate arrangements can be made.

## Additional Resources

- Physics tutoring center hours and location
- Online resources and simulations (e.g., PhET Interactive Simulations)
